## Permalink to a file in a specific commit
For a permanent link to the specific version of a file that you see, instead of using a branch name in the URL (i.e. the master part in the example above), put a commit id. This will permanently link to the exact version of the file in that commit.

Instead of  
[github/hubot/blob/master/README.md](https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/README.md)

Use  
[github/hubot/blob/ed25584f5ac2520a6c28547ffd0961c7abd7ea49/README.md](https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/ed25584f5ac2520a6c28547ffd0961c7abd7ea49/README.md)

## Keep in mind

- (Epic Win) Outcome so positive you had no idea it was possible untile achieve it.
- (Superstructuring) Working together at extreme scales (collaborate or perish, shared problem)
- (Games) Most elevated form of investigation
- (Tribe) shared interest & way to communicate, connected to leader and to idea
- (Goals) something specific and important to stick, matched with your current level
